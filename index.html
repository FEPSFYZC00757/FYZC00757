<p class="ex1">
    This article explores how personal data is generated, used, and monetised in the digital economy. It examines the ways companies like Google and Apple generate economic value from user information, while also highlighting the risks of privacy loss, surveillance, and growing market power. Finally, it also considers the future challenges of data protection, including the increasing difficulty of maintaining anonymity in a growing age where nearly all aspects of life are being integrated into data.

<h3 id="What is Personal Data?", style="font-family:calibri;">What is Personal Data?</h3>
    Personal Data is like money in a way that it is exchanged, sold, and purchased on digital markets. We don’t notice it, but everything we do online generates data. However, the difference between personal data and money is that data doesn’t have an inherent worth, its value is determined in its ability to be turned into knowledge and information.1 Consumers generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day.2 This includes information about what people buy, who they talk to, etc. Data mining can use machine learning to predict patterns in decision-making.3 Therefore, companies can use data mining to predict a wide array of things such as weather patterns. Through data mining, personal data can create economic value for tech companies and advertisers by turning raw user information into actionable insights that can be sold, used for marketing, or used to improve products.

<h3 id="How does Personal Data create economic value?", style="font-family:calibri;">How does Personal Data create economic value?</h3>
    One of the biggest uses of personal data is demonstrated by Google, who collect search histories, location data, YouTube viewing behaviour, emails, and app usage to build detailed user profiles. This allows Google to sell highly targeted Ads through either Google ads or YouTube Ads.4 
    A more unique use of personal data comes from Apple, collecting relatively little personal data and using it strategically to strengthen their ecosystem. More importantly, they use privacy as a selling point, giving their company a differentiation advantage. For example, in its “Personal Data Use for Personalised User Experiences” policy, Apple claims that they use limited personal data. Users can agree to receive marketing communications and when agreed upon they receive different types of marketing emails based on limited personal data that the user provides directly to Apple from their use of the App Store and their Apple Account. Moreover, majority of their data goes towards personalisation in the App Store, helping users find and discover content that is most relevant to them. This is demonstrated in the App Store’s ‘Today’ Tab, Search, and in the ‘More Games You Might Like’ section.5  So how does this generate economic value? Apple’s model differs from other companies whilst still using personal data to convert economic value by informing a better product/service design, enabling targeted services and ads, strengthening user lock-in (meaning that the lifetime value of each customer is increased), and creating a value proposition that supports their premium pricing and brand differentiation.
