<p class="ex1">
    This article explores how personal data is generated, used, and monetised in the digital economy. It examines the ways companies like Google and Apple generate economic value from user information, while also highlighting the risks of privacy loss, surveillance, and growing market power. Finally, it also considers the future challenges of data protection, including the increasing difficulty of maintaining anonymity in a growing age where nearly all aspects of life are being integrated into data.

<h3 id="What is Personal Data?", style="font-family:calibri;">What is Personal Data?</h3>
    Personal Data is like money in a way that it is exchanged, sold, and purchased on digital markets. We don’t notice it, but everything we do online generates data. However, the difference between personal data and money is that data doesn’t have an inherent worth, its value is determined in its ability to be turned into knowledge and information.1 Consumers generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day.2 This includes information about what people buy, who they talk to, etc. Data mining can use machine learning to predict patterns in decision-making.3 Therefore, companies can use data mining to predict a wide array of things such as weather patterns. Through data mining, personal data can create economic value for tech companies and advertisers by turning raw user information into actionable insights that can be sold, used for marketing, or used to improve products.
