<p class="ex1">
    This article explores the relationship between personal data and the digital economy. It begins by defining personal data, information that identifies, describes, or predicts individual behaviour, and it explains how it had become a core asset in todays markets. This article then explains how economic value is created through personal data, highlighting its role in targeted advertising, algorithmic decision-making, and the development of new technologies and business models. Finally, this article considers the risks associated with the use of personal data, including privacy breaches, surveillance, and unequal power dynamics between corporations. This article overall highlights the opportunities and challenges of the personal data economy. It underscores the need for stronger ethical standards and regulatory frameworks to ensure that data-driven growth follows individual rights.

    What is Personal Data?
Personal Data is like money in a way that it is exchanged, sold, and purchased on digital markets. We don’t notice it, but everything we do online generates data. However, the difference between personal data and money is that data doesn’t have an inherent worth, its value is determined in its ability to be turned into knowledge and information.1 Consumers generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day.2 This includes information about what people buy, who they talk to, etc. Data mining can use machine learning to predict patterns in decision-making.3 Therefore, companies can use data mining to predict a wide array of things such as weather patterns. Through data mining, personal data can create economic value for tech companies and advertisers by turning raw user information into actionable insights that can be sold, used for marketing, or used to improve products. 

How does Personal Data create economic value?
One of the biggest uses of personal data is demonstrated by Google, who collect search histories, location data, YouTube viewing behaviour, emails, and app usage to build detailed user profiles. This allows Google to sell highly targeted Ads through either Google ads or YouTube Ads.4 
A more unique use of personal data comes from Apple, collecting relatively little personal data and using it strategically to strengthen their ecosystem. More importantly, they use privacy as a selling point, giving their company a differentiation advantage. For example, in its “Personal Data Use for Personalised User Experiences” policy, Apple claims that they use limited personal data. Users can agree to receive marketing communications and when agreed upon they receive different types of marketing emails based on limited personal data that the user provides directly to Apple from their use of the App Store and their Apple Account. Moreover, majority of their data goes towards personalisation in the App Store, helping users find and discover content that is most relevant to them. This is demonstrated in the App Store’s ‘Today’ Tab, Search, and in the ‘More Games You Might Like’ section.5  So how does this generate economic value? Apple’s model differs from other companies whilst still using personal data to convert economic value by informing a better product/service design, enabling targeted services and ads, strengthening user lock-in (meaning that the lifetime value of each customer is increased), and creating a value proposition that supports their premium pricing and brand differentiation.

The Risks
When personal data is used for economic value, many risks emerge. One key risk is the erosion of privacy. Surveillance capitalism, a concept introduced by Shoshana Zuboff, describes how human experience is claimed as ‘free raw material’ for commercial practices of extraction and prediction.6 This means that users are no longer just consumers, instead they become the ‘objects from which raw materials are extracted,’ while the actual customers are advertisers and other third parties.7 Therefore, companies may steer behaviour and shape choices without transparent consent or accountability. 
Another critical risk lies in economic exploitation and market power. Firms that collect a vast amount of behavioural data often gain an advantage over competitors, allowing them to dominate markets and manipulate innovation. A recent study published by Springer found that when companies have unequal access to data, market can quickly become domination by one or two firms, constraining competition and innovation.8 These data monopolies not only distort market fairness but it also gives corporations power over consumers and smaller businesses.
